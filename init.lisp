;;; Commentary:

;; This file is my personal StumpWM configuration.
;; It works with StumpWM 18.05, sbcl 1.4.5.debian on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
;; See manual at: https://stumpwm.github.io/git/stumpwm-git.pdf

;;; Code:

(in-package :stumpwm)

;; load modules
(mapcar #'load-module '("ttf-fonts"
                        "swm-gaps"))

(defun load-conf-files (file-names)
  "Function to load a list of lisp files"
  (load (merge-pathnames (concat file-names ".lisp") *load-truename*)))


;; load the rest of the config files
(mapcar #'load-conf-files '("modeline"
                            "keys"
                            "general-settings"))
